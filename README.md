# google-homepage
A project Odin assignment where I attempted to clone the Google Home page. 
Many of the elements seem to be where they need to be, but as you'll see there are more that need plenty of work. I hope to again attempt another clone soon and correct my mistakes, but more importantly correct the application of the code and order of how I assign the sections.
